# ECHO BOT

This is a small echo-bot project done with Streamlit for the purpose of a workshop.

Serves as a boilerplate to later add an OpenAI connection so that we can create a Chat-GPT Clone Application using Streamlit.

## Installation

```cli
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Running the project

```cli
streamlit run main.py
```
